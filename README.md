# ✨ AutoCert

AutoCert is a platform for **Variable Data Printing**, **E-Signing**, and **Certificate Repository Management** — designed to simplify certificate generation, signing, and storage in one place.

## ✨ Setup

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to automatically format your code, AutoCert uses **Prettier**:

```bash
npm run format
```

## ✨ Development

To start the development server with **Turbopack**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

<!-- If you prefer using Docker for development:

```bash
docker-compose up
``` -->

## ✨ Production

To build the project:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

<!-- If you prefer using Docker for production:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
``` -->

## ✨ Testing

AutoCert uses **Vitest** for unit testing. To run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
